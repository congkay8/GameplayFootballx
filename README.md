# Gameplay Football
Football game, discontinued

In short, this game has pretty good potential gameplay-wise, but has architectural problems regarding the code. I would advise you *not* to continue development, but rather use the source as inspiration for your own game.
Another thing, this game uses my own multithreaded game engine (Blunted2), and no matter how cool that may sound, using a custom, badly documented engine just slows down development. Besides, a football game doesn't need to be *that* multithreaded, it just needlessly complicates things.

I don't offer support for this, so enjoy it but leave me alone ;)
